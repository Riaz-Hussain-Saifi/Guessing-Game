This is a simple guessing game developed by me. The game prompts the player to guess a number between 1 and 7. If the guessed number matches the randomly generated number, the player wins; otherwise, they lose. The game provides an option to play again if desired.

## Installation

You can install the Saifi Developer's Guessing Game package via npm:

```bash
npm install saifi_developer-guessing-game
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the game from the command line:

```bash
saifi_developer-guessing-game
```

Follow the instructions on the command line to play the game. Have fun guessing!
